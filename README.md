# TightEncoderSample
Tight Encoding of an image and decoding
The Solution captures an image and stores it as \WindowsProjectCapture\WindowsProjectCapture\captureqwsx.bmp.
Converts it into several small rectangles of size limited by 65536 pixels.
Encodes and draws the decoded image of the same which will be displayed in the window.
Tight encoding uses zlib and jpeg libraries for compression.
